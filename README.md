# Sudoku

[//]: # (TODO Add screen shot of app)
![Screenshot of app]()

[Here is the live version of my project](https://sudoku-creator-solver.herokuapp.com/)

The application is based on
a [Guardian newspaper Sudoku puzzle](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/sudoku).
The difficulty range was
inspired by the online version.

My partner's mother, Andrea Tschudi, really enjoys puzzles such
as [Doplo](https://sumaddle.com/fundamentals.html) (also
known as Smashed Sums) and Sudoku. As I am more familiar to Sudoku, I thought I
would create an application with Andrea
Tschudi in mind.

# How to Use

The 4 options are:

1. [Play](#play)
2. [Enter your own puzzle](#enter-your-own-puzzle)
3. [Solve a puzzle](#solve-a-puzzle)
4. [Instructions](#instructions)

### Play

*This option allows the user to choose their level of difficulty.*

* User is asked for their username
* They are then asked for the difficulty level they would like to play<br>
  :: Choosing from the following options<br>
    * 1 - Easy

* User is then prompted to enter the column letter (A-J, or a-j) and row
  number (1-9)
* User is then prompted to enter a number 1-9 to be placed in the row and cell
  they provided in the last prompt
* If the cell they selected already has a number that is part of the puzzle
  then they will receive feedback informing them that it is not possible to add
  a number in this cell
* If the cell they selected does not have a number that is not part of the
  puzzle, then the number will be printed into the grid
* Once there are no more numbers to enter, they user will be prompted to check
  the solution or exit the game

### Enter your own puzzle

*This option allows the user to enter their own puzzle into the grid.*<br>
*For example if they find a newspaper sudoku puzzle, but instead of using pen
and paper they would like to view the puzzle in the application.*

* User is prompted to add 9 rows
* A new grid with the puzzle will be printed on the screen
* The game will proceed as from the regular game play, from choosing the row
  and column

the game.*

* A Sudoku puzzle is created with a 9 by 9 square (9 rows and 9 columns).
* The 9 by 9 square is also divided into 3 by 3 areas (a total of 9 x 3 by 3
  areas).
* Each row, column and 3 by 3 area must contain numbers 1 - 9 (inclusive).
* Numbers cannot be repeated in the row, column nor 3 by 3 area

## Content

All text content and prompts created was kept short and direct. Ensuring the
characters would not wrap.
Puzzle difficulty was inspired by
the [Sudoku puzzles printed in the Guardian newspaper](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/sudoku)

## Media

No media, such as images or videos other than screenshots and screencast
attached to the README were used for the project.
