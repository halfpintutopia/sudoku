# Sudoku

[//]: # (TODO Add screen shot of app)
![Screenshot of app]()

[Here is the live version of my project](https://sudoku-creator-solver.herokuapp.com/)

The application is based on
a [Guardian newspaper Sudoku puzzle](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/sudoku). The difficulty range was
inspired by the online version.

My partner's mother, Andrea Tschudi, really enjoys puzzles such as [Doplo](https://sumaddle.com/fundamentals.html) (also
known as Smashed Sums) and Sudoku. As I am more familiar to Sudoku, I thought I would create an application with Andrea
Tschudi in mind.
