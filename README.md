# Sudoku

[//]: # (TODO Add screen shot of app)
![Screenshot of app]()

[Here is the live version of my project](https://sudoku-creator-solver.herokuapp.com/)

The application is based on a [Guardian newspaper Sudoku puzzle](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/sudoku). The difficulty range was inspired by the online version. 

My partner's mother, Andrea Tschudi, really enjoys puzzles such as [Doplo](https://sumaddle.com/fundamentals.html) (also known as Smashed Sums) and Sudoku. As I am more familiar to Sudoku, I thought I would create an application with Andrea Tschudi in mind.

- Each row, column and 3 by 3 area must contain numbers 1 - 9 (inclusive).
- Numbers cannot be repeated in the row, column nor 3 by 3 area
